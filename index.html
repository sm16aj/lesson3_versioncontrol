            </h2>
            <p class="lead">An important aspect in software configuration management, version control is the management of modifications done to software applications, sites, documents or any set of information. version control is provided in most software tools and word processors. As revision control is capable of reverting a modification done to its earlier state, it allows users to identify and correct errors and provide security to the data and information.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In a distributed system, you get a repository of your own when you clone the project. This means you can work and add code to the repo even when offline, since the repository lives on your computer. But this also means you need a bit of discipline in keeping in sync with the rest of development, since your repository is separate from the others.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git calls other repositories that it knows about remotes. By default, when you clone a repository it will save the parent repository under the name origin, so origin on your computer repository will be pointing to your personal Thematic fork on github. You can add as many remotes as you like and call them whatever you like. You could add a remote for everyone else that has also forked Thematic if you want to keep track of their work.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When you have made some changes that you want to save, you commit them to your repository. Commits are logical chunks of changes that gets saved in sequence, forming a history that you later can go through. Changes to several files can go in the same commit, it’s like you are saving the state of all the tracked files in your directory at once. Each commit gets a timestamp, an author name and email (which comes from a configuration file), a commit message and an automatically generated hash.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Pull</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">It can be tedious to always fetch changes first and then merge them, especially when you are certain you want to put the commits into your branch. Fortunately, there is a command that will do both things at once, pull. You can pull from any repository you like, you don’t need special permissions to do a pull. Usually you need specify which repository and which branch you want to pull from, and the pull will happen to the branch that is currently checked out in your directory.</p>
